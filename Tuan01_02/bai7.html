      A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. 
      It is believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. 
      Some smiles include a contration of the muscles at the cornet of the eyes, an action known as a "Duchene smile". 
      Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
